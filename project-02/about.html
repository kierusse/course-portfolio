    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="col1">
    <p class="p1">I am a 25 year old Computing Applications student serving active duty in the U.S. Navy. Before service, I attended community college in Texas and
        worked as a teacher then office manager of a tennis center before transitioning to behavioral therapy. My previous major was geophysics, and I continue to
        appreciate the outdoors in my leisure time. I am interested in adapting to a digital world and intertwining my foreign language skills with technology.
      <span class="indent"> Earning a Computing Applications degree places me one step closer to a master's degree in cyber systems and operations or computer science!
      My educational goals directly tie in to the plans I have set for myself career-wise as a sailor.</span></p></div>
