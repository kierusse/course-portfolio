                <h2>Jonas Brothers</h2>
                <p>Shoreline Amphitheater, Mountain View, CA 2023</p>
                <p>Went with my husband and appreciated the soundtrack to my childhood intertwining with my current life!</p>
            </li>

                <h2>Poppy</h2>
                <p>The Fillmore, Silver Spring, MD 2025</p>
                <p>I got to introduce some friends to her music and they joined the circle pit! I had met the singer at a past tour where the guitarist, who also played for Lady Gaga, tossed me his pick, and I knew this experience would be just as awesome. Once again, I headbanged at the barricade. The opening band's singer tossed me a water bottle and I got a designed and signed drumhead!</p>

                <h2>The Brokes</h2>
                <p>Bowery Ballroom, New York, NY 2025</p>
                <p>Normies see The Strokes. Real Strokes fans see The Brokes. A room full of pure appreciation for the music.</p>
            </li> 
             <li>
                <h2>Harry Styles</h2>
                <p>The Forum, Los Angeles, CA 2022</p>
                <p>He commands a stage so well! Incredibly talented. The live brass ensemble and light design added so much energy!</p>
            </li> 
             <li>
                <h2>Young the Giant</h2>
                <p>Let's Go Music Festival, Crownsvlle, MD 2025</p>
                <p>I wanted to see this band for 10 years, but always missed the opportunity. This festival was in my backyard and I was close enough to the stage to see the bassist's fingers! 15 Year old me would be happy to know I finally made it.</p>
